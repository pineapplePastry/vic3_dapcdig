## Description
This mod alters the following diplomatic actions by integrating the scripted effect from the Devout IG Converter Framework.
## What it does:
- Impose State Religion: Previously, this action only changed the state religion without converting the Devout interest group to match. For instance, Russia using this diplomatic action on a subject Mongolia would convert Mongolia to Orthodox, but the Vajrayana Monks would remain as Mongolia's Devout IG. This mod would also convert the Vajrayana Monks to the Orthodox Church, along with all the affiliated ideologies and traits.
- Change Language of Administration:	On top of the existing effects, this diplomatic action now also changes the target's state religion to yours, as well as its Devout IG to match.
